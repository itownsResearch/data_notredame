# Notre Dame dataset

This repository is a copy of the Notre Dame dataset available [here](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/datasets/) as part of the [Phototourism](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/) project.

It consists of a set of 715 Flickr unrectified images (rectified images are available in the original dataset) and a reconstruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.

Each image in this dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons license. Please respect these licenses, and give proper attribution when, for instance, publishing one of these images in a paper. See the README.txt file in each set for more instructions.

The bundler file format for the scene reconstruction (.out) files is described [here](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/bundler-v0.3-manual.html#S6).
